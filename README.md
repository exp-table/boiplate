# boiplate

Test with foundry, script with hardhat.

## Getting Started

Click `use this template` on [Github](https://github.com/exp-table/boiplate) to create a new repository with this repo as the initial state.

## Development

The way this template is configured, all dependencies used in the contracts (with the exception of the test files) need to be installed as npm packages to enable hardhat scripting.


**Setup**
```bash
forge install
npm install
```

**Building**
```bash
forge build
```

**Testing**
```bash
forge test
```

**Run a script**
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/[filename].js
```

### First time with Forge/Foundry?

See the official Foundry installation [instructions](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/master/README.md#installation).

Then, install the [foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry) toolchain installer (`foundryup`) with:
```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Now that you've installed the `foundryup` binary,
anytime you need to get the latest `forge` or `cast` binaries,
you can run `foundryup`.

So, simply execute:
```bash
foundryup
```

ðŸŽ‰ Foundry is installed! ðŸŽ‰

### Writing Tests with Foundry

With [Foundry](https://gakonst.xyz), tests are written in Solidity! ðŸ¥³

Create a test file for your contract in the `src/tests/` directory.

For example, [`src/Femboi.sol`](./src/Femboi.sol) has its test file defined in [`./src/tests/Femboi.t.sol`](./src/tests/Femboi.t.sol).

To learn more about writing tests in Solidity for Foundry, reference Rari Capital's [solmate](https://github.com/Rari-Capital/solmate/tree/main/src/test) repository created by [@transmissions11](https://twitter.com/transmissions11).

### Configure Foundry

Using [foundry.toml](./foundry.toml), Foundry is easily configurable.

For a full list of configuration options, see the Foundry [configuration documentation](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/master/config/README.md#all-options).
